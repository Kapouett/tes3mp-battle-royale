# TES3MP Battle Royale Prototype

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-spaghetti-orange.svg)](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_172856_HvF2J.jpg)

Battle Royale game mode for TES3MP 0.7.0-alpha.

This is far from finished, so I won't write anything useful here for now.

- `scripts/custom/testBR.lua` is the file with most of the code.
- `scripts/custom/testBRLootManager`.lua manages loot tables and loot spawning logic.
- `scripts/custom/testBRConfig.lua` contains settings for the Battle Royale scripts.
- `data` contains images to draw fog on the map and custom records needed for the script to work, as well as a sample loot table.

## Installation
Drop the script and data folders in your server folder and add `require("custom/testBR")` to scripts/customScripts.lua.

Edit the `scripts/player/base.lua` file to replace `BasePlayer:Resurrect()` with
```
function BasePlayer:Resurrect() -- Modified respawning behavior for Battle Royale
	-- Ensure that dying as a werewolf turns you back into your normal form
    if self.data.shapeshift.isWerewolf == true then
        self:SetWerewolfState(false)
    end

    -- Ensure that we unequip deadly items when applicable, to prevent an
    -- infinite death loop
    contentFixer.UnequipDeadlyItems(self.pid)

	tes3mp.Resurrect(self.pid, enumerations.resurrect.REGULAR)
end
```
Adjust configuration in `scripts/custom/testBRConfig.lua`, **espacially the lobby cell** because I use the french version of the game, so I set the lobby as "Vivec, fosse de l'Ar√®ne".

## Recommended changes to config.lua
- allowWildernessRest = false
- config.allowWait = false
- shareMapExploration = false
- respawnAtImperialShrine = false
- respawnAtTribunalTemple = false
- playersRespawn = true
- bountyResetOnDeath = true
- bountyDeathPenalty = false

## Usage
### Users
- `/newmatch` to propose a new match
- `/join` to join a match proposition. This will put them in the lobby
- `/ready` when you are in a lobby (the match will start when everyone is ready)
### Admins
- `/forcestartmatch` to force the current proposition to start
- `/forceend` terminates the current match
- `/forcenextfog` makes the fog to progress instantly
